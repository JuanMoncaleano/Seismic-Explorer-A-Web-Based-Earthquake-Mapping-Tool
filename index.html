        <h2>Earthquake Depth Information</h2>
        <p>
          Shallow Earthquakes (0-70 km deep) Intensity: Shallow earthquakes
          often produce stronger shaking near the epicenter compared to deep
          earthquakes of similar magnitude. Damage: They are generally more
          destructive in terms of structural damage, landslides, and tsunamis.
          Area Affected: The area of strong shaking is usually more localized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intermediate-depth Earthquakes (70-300 km deep) Intensity: The shaking
          is generally less intense near the surface than it is for shallow
          earthquakes. Damage: They usually cause less damage to structures near
          the surface. Area Affected: The area of strong shaking can be more
          widespread, affecting regions farther from the epicenter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep Earthquakes (300-700 km deep) Intensity: These earthquakes
          typically produce the least amount of shaking near the Earth's
          surface. Damage: They are the least likely to cause significant damage
          or tsunamis. Area Affected: The shaking can be felt over a large area,
          but it's generally not strong enough to cause damage.
