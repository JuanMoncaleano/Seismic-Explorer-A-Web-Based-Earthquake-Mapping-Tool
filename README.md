# Seismic Explorer: A Web-Based Earthquake Mapping Tool
Module 15 Challenge

Overview
This project consists of a simple Leaflet map that displays earthquake data. The website includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Files
1. index.html
This file contains the main HTML structure of the website. It includes references to the Leaflet library and local CSS and JavaScript files. The main content is a map container that holds the Leaflet map.

2. style.css
This CSS file contains styling rules for the website. It sets the padding, margin, and height for the body and map elements, ensuring that the map takes up the full viewport.

3. logic.js
This JavaScript file contains the logic for initializing the Leaflet map, adding a tile layer, and fetching earthquake data from a remote URL. The earthquake data is then iterated through to extract relevant properties.

How to Run

Place all three files in the same directory.
Open index.html in a modern web browser.
The map with earthquake data should be displayed.
Dependencies
Leaflet library (version 1.9.4 or later)
